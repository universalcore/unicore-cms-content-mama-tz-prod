  "content": "Two months ago, I left my job to look for work that I can do from home. I do\nneed to work to bring in extra money \u2013 but I\u2019m pregnant with my second child.\nWe didn\u2019t plan to have another baby right now. We cannot even pay for\nchildcare for one child, and soon we will have two. My husband has been taking\non extra shifts to help. It\u2019s tough because now he is hardly ever at home and\nwe don\u2019t see much of each other. For the past two months I\u2019ve been waking up\nat 5am to do some housework before my little one wakes and I get her ready for\nschool. After I have taken her to school, I walk around the neighbourhood\nlooking for work. I ask if there are any cleaning jobs I could do. I fetch my\ndaughter from school at 2pm, and then I have to keep her entertained, start\nmaking supper and the cleaning routine starts again. Because I am so far into\nmy pregnancy, I am heavy and tired all the time. I want to sit down and put my\nfeet up, but there is no time for that. I have to do odd jobs and try to make\nwhat money I can. Now, I am wondering what it's going to be like when I have\ntwo. A toddler and a newborn. I have no time for my husband. I\u2019m pregnant and\nexhausted. So how will I find time for my new baby or myself? Somehow I know\nthat I must cope. Many women have done it before me. But sometimes it feels\nimpossible. **MAMA HELP: Are you expecting your 2nd or 3rd child? You will\nneed help. Reach out to trusted older family members and friends who have\nchildren. If you are tired and alone, you may not be able to give your best to\nyour children. Ask for help and share child-minding duties with others.**\n\n",
