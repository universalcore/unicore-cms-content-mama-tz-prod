You and your growing baby need lots of different foods. \r\n\r\nA simple way to think about it is to eat lots of different coloured foods! \r\n\r\nYou could talk to your family about the foods you need.\r\n\r\nTry to eat some of each of these food types every day: \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tFruits and vegetables. These protect your baby from being born with a problem.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStarchy foods. These include maize, cassava and sorghum. These foods give you energy.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tFoods rich in protein. These include eggs, beans, chicken, fish, and meat. These are body building foods.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCalcium rich and dairy foods.
