  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Your baby is getting more flexible. He may enjoy opening\r\nand closing his fingers, or clapping his hands. Your baby's sense of humour is\r\ndeveloping, too. A tickle or a noisy kiss on his tummy is likely to make him\r\nchuckle. Right from birth, your baby loves to be touched. It's important for\r\nhis growth and development. About now, different textures will start to\r\ninterest your baby As he starts to understand the world, just playing helps\r\nyour baby's brain to grow. As his brain develops, he is getting more curious.\r\nHe may play with a small toy that he can hold and shake about. He will be\r\nlearning about colour, shape and size, too. He also learns from the noise a\r\ntoy makes and from feeling if it is soft or hard. At this age, if he is on his\r\nbelly, he may lift up his head and shoulders, using his arms for support. Your\r\nbaby may even be able to roll over from his front to his back. Encourage him\r\nby jiggling a toy on the side he usually rolls to. Clap and smile when he\r\ndoes!\r\n\r\n",
