  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Your baby is changing quickly. She can make basic\nsounds. She may even say something that sounds like \u2018Ma-ma\u2019 this month! Don't\nworry if she doesn't. All babies develop differently. So far, she has needed\nyour full-time attention. Now she may be happy amusing herself sometimes. You\nmay find her happily playing with her hands and feet! At this age, it is good\nfor your baby to be with loved ones or trusted friends. As she grows, your\nbaby will need to learn social skills and how to interact with others. Your\nfamily will love having a cuddle! You can give her lots of cuddles when you\nget back. Even though crying is still your baby's best form of communication,\nshe is also getting a sense of humour. Play peek-a-boo with her. See if she\nlaughs when your face appears from under a blanket. Your baby will start to\ngiggle and smile when you make funny faces and she will enjoy lots of\nsilliness. She will also enjoy hearing lots of sounds. Click your tongue,\nwhistle or make animal noises. She will love it.\n\n",
