Dangling cords or plants may tempt him to reach up and pull things over on himself.\r\n\r\nPut purses, bags and shopping up high so he cannot reach them. Even simple everyday things like lipstick and make-up can harm him.\r\n\r\nMake sure that medicines and tablets are out of his reach.\r\n\r\nKeep him away from latrines and dirty clothes. Also make sure he plays far away from water, animals and their stools.\r\n\r\nThe ground can also be home to worms and insects. If you can, clean the floor with soap and water before your baby plays there. This will help keep him safe, and stop him getting worms. If you cannot clean the floor, put down a large, clean sheet or mat.\r\n\r\nWhen your baby is standing and walking, make sure you cover his feet with loose socks or slippers. This will protect him from worms.\r\n",
