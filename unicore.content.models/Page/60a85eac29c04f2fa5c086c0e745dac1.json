You will be able to see her swallow while she is feeding, and your breasts will feel emptier and softer after feeds.\r\n\r\nAnother good sign is if your baby changes rhythm while sucking and pauses during feeds. She should start feeding again when she is ready, and come off your breast when she wants to.\r\n\r\nYour baby's nappies can also show if your baby is getting enough milk. Her stools should be a yellow colour and she may pass them often. As she gets older, she may pass stools only once a week. If she is only dirtying her nappy every third day or even just once a week, she is still fine. She does not need any herbal remedies or extra water for constipation.\r\n\r\nWhen you change her nappy, the urine she passes should be pale and should have no smell. She should have at least 6 to 8 wet nappies every day. If you notice orange or brick coloured stains in your baby's nappy, do not worry. This can happen sometimes in hot and humid weather. Just keep feeding your baby as often as she wants to. \r\n\r\nA baby who gets enough milk will also have firm, healthy coloured skin that gets firm again quickly when lightly pinched.\r\n\r\nIf you are worried that your baby is not getting enough milk, ask a health worker. They will be able to check that your baby is healthy.\r\n",
