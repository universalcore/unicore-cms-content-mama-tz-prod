This can make you very tired. Even if you are usually awake late, you might struggle to stay awake past the early evening now.\r\n\r\nMake sure you take short rests, more often, during the daytime. Try to rest in the hottest part of the day, especially when it is wet and humid. Drink plenty of clean, safe water through the day, too.  This will help your body to cope with the pregnancy and you will feel less tired.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of pregnancy, you may feel constantly tired. Your body is using a lot of energy and food to grow your tiny baby. By 3 months you will feel less tired but taking enough rest in the daytime is still important.\r\n\r\nYour hormone levels and need for energy are also changing fast. Your blood sugar and blood pressure tend to be lower too. This all adds to tiredness.\r\n\r\nHaving low iron levels can also make you feel tired. Your doctor may ask you to take a daily iron tablet. This is very important for your and your baby's health. If your iron levels are very low, you will feel even more tired and lacking in energy. Iron tablets cannot darken your baby's complexion. This is not true. If you find that the tablets make you constipated, tell your doctor so she can prescribe a different kind of tablet.\r\n",
