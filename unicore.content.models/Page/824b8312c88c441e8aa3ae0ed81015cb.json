  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Your baby is ready to start family food along with\r\nbreastmilk! He can only have a tiny amount of food at first: just a spoonful\r\nis enough. He will enjoy mashed family food. Sit facing him and offer some\r\nsoft food on your clean finger or on a spoon. It may take him a while to know\r\nhow to move the food around with his tongue and swallow it. Be patient. He\r\nwill learn. Give him mashed food once a day to begin. Then twice a day and\r\nthen three times a day. He may want some breastmilk before the mashed food,\r\nand some more breastmilk after the mashed food. This could be the month your\r\nbaby gets his first tooth. One of the bottom front teeth usually appears\r\nfirst. He may start to use one hand more than the other. Then he may switch\r\nhands. But you won't really know whether he is right or left-handed until he's\r\ntwo or three years old. Let him hold a small object and pass it from hand to\r\nhand. This will help him develop his skills. Your baby is probably getting\r\nmore active now, and will enjoy the company of other babies! Does your baby\r\nlike a certain object or toy? If so, soon he will not be able to go anywhere\r\nwithout it. This is normal, and a sign of your baby's growing independence,\r\nbecause he can use a toy or cloth for reassurance instead of you.\r\n\r\n",
