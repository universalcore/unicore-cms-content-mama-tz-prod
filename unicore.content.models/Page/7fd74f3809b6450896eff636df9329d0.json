  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Your baby will start to want to feed herself now.\r\nPerhaps she grabs the spoon you are feeding her with, or takes food from your\r\nplate? Try putting small chunks of soft foods on her plate. She will love\r\npicking them up and eating them! Remember girls need the same amount of food\r\nas boys. Your baby may have a good appetite, but not many teeth. Start with\r\nfood that a she can gum or easily move round her mouth. At this age babies get\r\ncurious. She might throw toys or pull her sister's hair! Your baby is just\r\ntesting things out, not being bad. She won\u2019t remember things for very long, so\r\nreprimands will not mean much to her yet. But she can be distracted easily. So\r\nshow her a toy or sing her a song to stop her doing things you don\u2019t want her\r\nto do. Don't worry if she has gaps between her teeth. The spaces between your\r\nbaby's teeth will probably close up by the time she's three, once all of her\r\nbaby teeth have grown. Around now, your baby may get nervous about you going\r\naway. She is so attached to you that leaving her, even for a minute, may make\r\nher cry. This is normal, and short separations will help your baby socialise\r\nwith other people. Soon she will learn that you always come back to her. By\r\nnow your baby's emotions are getting more obvious. She may blow a kiss to\r\npeople she knows. She is also beginning to notice other people's moods and\r\ncopy them. If she sees someone crying, she may start crying, too.\r\n\r\n",
