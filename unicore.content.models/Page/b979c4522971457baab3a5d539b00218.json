  "content": "The Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) is a global movement that seeks\nto use mobile technologies to improve the health and lives of mothers in\ndeveloping nations. MAMA is a partnership between the U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID), Johnson & Johnson, the United Nations\nFoundation, and BabyCenter and operates through a secretariat hosted by the\nmHealth Alliance. It was launched on Mother\u2019s Day 2011 by U.S. Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton. MAMA\u2019s efforts align with the UN Secretary-General\u2019s\nEvery Woman Every Child campaign and efforts to achieve Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs) 4 and 5. To this end, MAMA engages an innovative global community\nto deliver vital health information to new and expectant mothers through\nmobile phones. **How to use MAMA** Mothers are invited to register for the\nservice by indicating their expected due-date, or the birthday of their\nrecently-born child, and receive weekly health messages and reminders during\nthe pregnancy and up to the child\u2019s first birthday. Timed messages include\ntips on everything from proper nutrition, how to keep the baby warm after\nbirth, and breastfeeding. Improving the health and status of mothers acts as a\npositive multiplier. When mothers succeed, they lift themselves out of\npoverty, and they lift their families and their communities along with them.\nMobile phones are one of the innovative tools they can use. MAMA is a single\nresource for mothers to find life-saving information on maternal and infant\nhealth, up-to-date support on HIV+ pregnancies and vital Help numbers.\n**Content Credits** Pages have been donated for publication on this mobisite\nby BabyCenter, a leading maternal and infant health resource.
