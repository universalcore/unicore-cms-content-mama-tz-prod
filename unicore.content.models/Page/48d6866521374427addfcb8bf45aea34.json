  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nFeeling like vomiting? This is normal. Lots of women feel like this in pregnancy.\r\n\r\nEveryone feels different. Some feel just a bit nauseous in the morning, and some find certain smells make them feel nauseous all day. Most women feel better by 3 months, but it could last longer. \r\n\r\nIf cooking smells make you feel sick, ask if another member of your family can cook instead. You might not like the taste of some foods. But there are others that can help. For example, try adding a few drops of ginger juice, mint leaves or fresh lemon juice to your food. These will help with the smell and might make the food more acceptable to you.\r\n\r\nYou could avoid spicy food, too. Some women find they can eat cold food but not warm food.\r\n\r\nIf you feel nauseous mostly in the mornings, it might help if you can eat some plain rice, rusk or a biscuit, before you get out of bed. \r\n\r\nAlso, try eating small meals, but more often.\r\n\r\nSome grated ginger or lemon juice into a cup of tea or even just the smell of freshly grated ginger or lemon can help. You could also try mint (pudina) tea, or chewing cardamom.\r\n\r\nExplain to your family how you are feeling and what you need. Do not feel guilty about asking for help with things like fetching water, digging, washing clothes, cooking and other chores.\r\n\r\nFeeling nauseous and vomiting is normal in pregnancy, but if you are vomiting many times a day, if you are unable to eat and drink without vomiting, and if you are losing weight, you may need treatment by a doctor. Continue to take your pregnancy tablets, even if you feel nauseous.\r\n",
