  "content": "Created by BabyCenter \r\n\r\nYour baby starts to understand simple words and phrases.\r\nTry repeating his words back to him, using adult language. \r\n\r\nSlowly, he will\r\nlearn to be independent, and will cry less when you leave him. But, sometimes,\r\nleaving him goes badly and there will be tears! If he has something that\r\nsmells of you, like clothes you have worn, it will help him to settle. \r\n\r\nAt this\r\nage, your baby can sit confidently and may walk while he holds onto furniture.\r\nHe may even let go for a second and stand without support, or even take a few\r\nsteps if you hold his hands. \r\n\r\nAround this age, your baby will learn to hand-\r\nfeed himself an entire meal. He will want to drink from a cup. This is a new\r\nskill, and he will need to practice for a few months to learn how! \r\n\r\nYour baby\r\ncan understand simple instructions now. But this doesn\u2019t mean he will always\r\npay attention to the word \u2018no\u2019! He will understand \u2018no\u2019 better if it is mainly\r\nused to help him learn the difference between right and wrong, and safe and\r\nunsafe.\r\n\r\n",
