  "content": "Created by BabyCenter She is used to her surroundings and she likes familiar\nthings. At this age, she may be clingy and need distracting. She may feel\ncalmer if she can keep her own blanket or favourite toy with her, so she\ncarries a little bit of home when she goes out. Quiet time away from noise and\nstrangers will also help her to adjust. By now, your baby remembers things,\nlike where her toys are kept. She can also copy actions she has seen as far\nback as two weeks ago. But she still can\u2019t remember everything. Your baby's\nlong-lasting memory may not develop until she is two or three years old. Your\nbaby's babbling may begin to sound more like real words. Your baby thinks she\nis saying something, so respond as if she really is! She\u2019ll learn about\nconversation and facial expressions from you when you talk to her and look at\nher. Your baby still understands more from your tone than from your actual\nwords. She knows when she has made you happy, so offer lots of praise. Your\nbaby's personality is really coming out now. She may be sociable and smile at\neveryone she meets, or she may be shy and hide her face. Your baby knows how\nto get your attention now, and may wave goodbye when she sees you go to the\ndoor.\n\n",
