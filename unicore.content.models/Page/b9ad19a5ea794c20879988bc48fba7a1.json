  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Your baby is much stronger now. She might be able to\r\nhold up her head for a few seconds. She can now focus better with her eyes and\r\nher vision is improving. You might see your baby looking at her own hands. She\r\nis starting to understand that it is her hand and she can use it. Soon she\r\nwill reach out to grasp things. She also listens better, and understands where\r\nsounds come from. You may see her turn her head toward sounds. About now, you\r\nwill notice your baby stays awake longer in the daytime, and has definite\r\ntimes when she wants to play. She is beginning to know night from day. Soon,\r\nshe will begin to love stretching her arms and legs. Give your baby enough\r\nspace to stretch. Lay a blanket on the floor and let her move around on it.\r\nThis helps to strengthen her growing muscles. If she is lying on her belly,\r\nshe may start to push off with her legs. She\u2019s on her way to moving around!\r\nYou may think your baby is too young to sing or talk to, but it is a good idea\r\nif you do. Hearing you sing or talk to her will help her learn to talk. If she\r\nlooks the other way or loses interest while you are singing or talking to her,\r\njust try something else or give her time to rest.\r\n\r\n",
