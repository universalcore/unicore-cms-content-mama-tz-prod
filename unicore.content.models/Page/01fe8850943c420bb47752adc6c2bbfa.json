They help your baby grow healthily and keep your body in good shape for becoming a mother.  \r\n\r\nEat a variety of fresh foods of different colours each day to get vitamins.  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tEggs, orange-coloured fruit and vegetables like mangoes and papaya. These foods contain vitamin A, which helps your baby's organs and body systems to develop.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tChicken, beans, and green vegetables. These foods supply B vitamins to help your body use protein, fats, and carbohydrates. They also help form new red blood cells and develop the brain and nerves.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCitrus fruits like oranges and lemons. These are all good sources of vitamin C, which is needed for repairing and growing skin and body tissue. It also helps growth and strengthens bones and teeth. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tOily fish, like sardines, eggs and red meat. These contain vitamin D, which helps to build bones and teeth and helps you to fight germs. Our bodies can also make vitamin D from sunlight. \r\n",
