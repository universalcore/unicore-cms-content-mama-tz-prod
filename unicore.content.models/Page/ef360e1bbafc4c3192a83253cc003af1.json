Your body is very good at making milk, but if you don't eat enough you may feel tired and faint. \r\n\r\nTry to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Think about eating a variety of colours each day. Eat energy-giving food like cassava and maize. Eat protein, found in eggs, beans, lentils, chickpeas, fish, poultry and meat. Eat cheese, yoghurt and milk products too. Just eat a good variety, and your body will get all it needs to help you to feed your baby well.\r\n\r\nTry to eat 3 main meals a day at regular times.  Eat plenty of snacks throughout the day to keep up your energy levels. You don\u2019t have to wait for a big meal. Good snacks to try are dried fruit, nuts, fresh fruit and vegetables and seeds. Continue to take your iron pills while you are breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding can make you feel thirsty, too. Have a drink before you feed your baby. Clean, safe water is good. You don\u2019t have to drink milk to make milk, but you do need to drink plenty of clean safe water. Do not drink too much tea, coffee, cola or fizzy drinks. Just 1 or 2 glasses of these a day is enough.\r\n\r\nIf you don't feel like eating, it could be a sign that you need extra support. If it is a struggle to eat, and you are forcing yourself, talk to your health worker. \r\n",
