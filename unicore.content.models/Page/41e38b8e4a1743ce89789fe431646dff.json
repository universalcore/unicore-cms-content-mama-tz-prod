  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nSome women want to keep their pregnancy a secret at first.\r\n\r\nBut telling your doctor or health worker does not mean you have to tell everyone else. \r\n\r\nTalking about being pregnant with a health worker will be good for you and your baby. It will mean fewer problems if you get the right care early on.\r\n\r\nWhen you register at a health centre or clinic, you can have tests to make sure that you and your baby are healthy. You can have blood and urine tests, and tests for HIV.\r\n\r\nYour doctor may also give you free tablets that all pregnant women need to take to stay healthy and to grow a healthy baby.\r\n\r\nIf you know you are living with HIV, you may be able to have free medication to prevent your baby from becoming HIV+. \r\n\r\nEven if you feel well, get regular check-ups so that you and your baby can stay healthy.\r\n",
