Listen to her\ncarefully and respond to her sounds. This will encourage her. She is nearly a\nwhole year old now! Even if she doesn't understand exactly what\u2019s going on, at\nthis age, festivals and celebrations with family and friends give her feelings\nof security and community. She will enjoy simple celebrations, close to home.\nShe may feel overwhelmed if there are too many people around. You may notice\nyour baby is still finding out about objects by putting them in her mouth. She\nmay also climb onto a chair to get to things up high! Take care now, watch her\nand make sure harmful objects are out of the way. Your baby wants to please\nyou, so it is never too soon to teach her how to help out. Make chores fun by\nturning it into a game. Break the task into small parts and give a helping\nhand. Your baby may be walking already, or she will take her first steps soon.\nYou can have fun teaching her to walk. Stand or kneel in front of her and hold\nout your hands. Try holding both her hands and walking her towards you. She\nmay take her first steps with her arms out to the side and bent at the elbows.\nShe may also turn out her feet and stick out her bottom for balance.\n\n",
