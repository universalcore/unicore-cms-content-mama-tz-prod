  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nYou and your baby need plenty of calcium. Eat or drink foods containing calcium every day. They will help you to stay well and your baby to grow strong bones and teeth. Ask for calcium tablets at the health facility.\r\n\r\nCalcium is a mineral that helps bones and teeth to grow. You need plenty of calcium, because your bones are still growing too. It may also help to reduce the risk of high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nCalcium forms your baby's bones and teeth. It also helps to control the rhythm of his heart. If you are not getting enough calcium, your baby will not go without, but you will. That is because, where minerals are concerned, your body puts your baby first.\r\n\r\nYou can get calcium from:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCheese, milk, milk products and yoghurt \r\n\r\n\u2022\tCoconut milk\r\n\r\n\u2022\tgreen leafy vegetables\r\n\r\n\u2022\tfish, especially oily fish like sardines\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSesame seeds and nuts\r\n\r\nTo help you absorb calcium, you also need to make sure that you are getting enough vitamin D. Your body makes vitamin D from sunlight.\r\n",
