You could try to save your money to help pay for things that you and your baby might need.\r\n\r\nSmoking and chewing when you are pregnant can make your baby very weak and sickly. It is also bad for your baby when you are breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nYou could ask your family to help you to stop smoking. You might let them know that smoke in the house is also bad for the baby. Maybe you could ask them to stop with you. Let them know what smoking does to the baby and then ask anyone who smokes in the house to smoke outside, now you are pregnant. \r\n\r\nIf you smoke, start cutting down or quit. It might be hard, but it is definitely worth it for your baby. Start by cutting down small amounts every day. If you are finding it really difficult to cut down, talk to your health worker.\r\n",
